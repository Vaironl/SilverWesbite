<p>I am a Senior ODU Online CS student hoping to graduate in the spring. This will be my second bachelor's degree with my first being in Social Science from JMU. I currently live in Richmond with my wife, two cats, and our dog. When I am not debugging assembly or revising a relational algebra query for the umpteenth time, I like to kayak, brew beer, cook, bbq, and tend to our garden. To help make ends meet I currently work at Estes Express Lines, a shipping company, but will be hoping to get a job in software development after getting my degree.</p>
