He enjoys programming first and foremost, but also pursues other technology related interests such as computer graphics, game design, and information technology. He dreams of one day finding work out on the west coast of the United States, specifically California. He wants to be able to walk into work, sipping a cup of coffee, and enjoy the nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge before he sits down to work on an epic project by one of the foremost Silicon Valley giants. He understands however, that the journey is sometimes as important as the destination.

                  David Hall - I am a Senior ODU Online CS student hoping to graduate in the spring. This will be my second bachelor's degree with my first being in Social Science from JMU. I currently live in Richmond with my wife, two cats, and our dog. When I am not debugging assembly or revising a relational algebra query for the umpteenth time, I like to kayak, brew beer, cook, bbq, and tend to our garden. To help make ends meet I currently work at Estes Express Lines, a shipping company, but will be hoping to get a job in software development after getting my degree.

I enjoy programming in my free time and playing video games like Minecraft and Pokemon. I also play soccer and volleyball at every chance I get. Back home, I work on a drone with two colleagues from Virginia Tech. I hope to someday work in a company that integrates software engineering with mechanical and electrical engineering. But beware, I also have a tendency to follow people and explode when I get close.

                  Dear Waldo
                  I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you return my pet Creeper to me by sundown, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will spawn camp you. For I am JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
